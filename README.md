# Retail Analysis

This project focus on creating a detail analysis and machine learning for decision making predictions based on [Manjeetsingh's retail dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset) from Kaggle.

# Purpose of the project
Industrial machine learning is becoming a standard practice for retail companies. With a better insight of the data and given predictions of each store, the company can better make business decisions to maximize the profit. We decided to work on this project because we believe it's going to be a good practice and a real life example on where we could work on our data science skills with noticeable results.
